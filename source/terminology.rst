Terminology
===========

This document abides by Section 13.1 of the IEEE Standards Style
Manual, which describes the use of the words "shall", "should", "may",
and "can" in a document as follows.

- The word *shall* is used to indicate mandatory requirements strictly
  to be followed in order to conform to the Specification and from
  which no deviation is permitted (*shall* equals *is required to*).
- The use of the word *must* is deprecated and shall not be used when
  stating mandatory requirements; must is used only to describe
  unavoidable situations
- The use of the word *will* is deprecated and shall not be used when
  stating mandatory requirements; will is only used in statements of
  fact
- The word *should* is used to indicate that among several
  possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable, without
  mentioning or excluding others; or that a certain course of action
  is preferred but not necessarily required; or that (in the negative
  form) a certain course of action is deprecated but not prohibited
  (*should* equals *is recommended that*).
- The word *may* is used to indicate a course of action permissible
  within the limits of the Specification (*may* equals *is permitted
  to*).
- The word *can* is used for statements of possibility and capability,
  whether material, physical, or casual (*can* equals *is able to*).

Unless explicitly designated informative, all sections are normative.
